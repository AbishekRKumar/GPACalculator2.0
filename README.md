# Welcome to OUSL GPA Calculator 2.0

Welcome to OUSL GPA Calculator 2.0, a thoughtfully designed web application developed by R. Abishek, an undergraduate student pursuing a BSc in Natural Sciences at The Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL). This tool was created to empower students by simplifying the process of calculating and tracking their Grade Point Average (GPA)—a critical metric in determining academic success and future opportunities.

As an Open and Distance Learning (ODL) university, OUSL presents unique challenges for its students. Unlike traditional universities, where academic progress might be more closely monitored, ODL (Open and distance learning) students like us often manage their studies independently, making it harder to keep track of their GPA over time. Yet, this number is vital: it determines eligibility for special degree programs, whether a student graduates with a class (e.g., First Class or Second Class honors), or even if they qualify for a degree at all. Recognizing this, I developed OUSL GPA Calculator 2.0 to bridge that gap, offering an accessible and efficient way to monitor academic performance.

My goal was to create a tool that not only calculates your GPA instantly but also provides features like course management, data persistence, and multi-language support to cater to OUSL’s diverse student body across all six faculties—Natural Sciences, Engineering Technology, Humanities and Social Sciences, Education, Health Sciences, and Management Studies. I envisioned a user-friendly platform where students could input their courses, download their records, and plan their academic journey with confidence. Beyond OUSL, I realized this tool could benefit students from other state and private universities in Sri Lanka and beyond, as GPA tracking is a universal need in higher education.

I believe this calculator is important because it empowers students to take control of their academic narrative. For OUSL students, it alleviates the stress of manual calculations and uncertain progress tracking in an ODL environment. For non-OUSL students, it offers a flexible, reliable resource adaptable to various grading systems. My expectation was simple yet ambitious: to make the process of understanding and managing GPA easier, so every student—whether at OUSL or elsewhere—can focus on learning and achieving their goals.

## How It Works
The calculator uses the standard GPA formula:

```
GPA = (Σ (Grade Point × Credit Hours)) / (Total Credit Hours)
```

- Each course’s grade is mapped to a grade point (e.g., A = 4.0, B = 3.0) based on OUSL’s grading scale.
- The grade point is multiplied by the course’s credit hours, summed across all courses, and divided by the total credit hours.

### Example
| Course Name   | Credit Hours | Grade | Grade Point |
|---------------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| Math          | 3            | A     | 4.0         |
| Physics       | 4            | B+    | 3.3         |
| History       | 2            | A-    | 3.7         |

**GPA**: `( (4.0 × 3) + (3.3 × 4) + (3.7 × 2) ) / (3 + 4 + 2) = 3.67`
